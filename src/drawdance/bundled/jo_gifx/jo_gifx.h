 * This is a heavily modified version of jo_gif, a simple, minimalistic GIF
 * writer by Jon Olick, placed into the public domain: http://jonolick.com
 *
 * It has been modified to support big endian machines, bgra color instead of
 * argb, output-agnostic functions and error checking. It also doesn't use large
 * stack structures and doesn't allocate and free memory for each frame, instead
 * it does a single allocation to hold everything.
