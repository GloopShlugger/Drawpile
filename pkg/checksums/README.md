# Artifact Checksums

This directory contains artifact checksums by version in the following formats:

* SHA256 checksums in `sha256sums.txt` for use with `sha256sum`
* SHA384 checksums in `sha384sums.txt` for use with `sha256sum`
* BLAKEb2 checksums in `b2sums.txt` for use with `b2sum`

Verify that the checksums were added with a signed commit to ensure integrity. Identical files should also be available under `https://drawpile.net/files/checksums/$VERSION/*sums.txt`.
