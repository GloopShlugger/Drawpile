Drawpile is a collaborative drawing program that lets multiple people draw, sketch, paint and animate on the same canvas simultaneously.

The Android version works on both tablets and phones. The program is built for use primarily with a pressure-sensitive pen, but drawing via touch is also possible.

If you have any questions, need help with anything or can't manage to get the application working, check out the help page on drawpile.net on how to get in contact!
